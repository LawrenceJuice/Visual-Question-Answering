This project developed a VQA model using a pre-trained Swin Transformer for image feature extraction and a pre-trained BERT for text encoding. 
The integrated visual and textual features are fed into a classifier to predict the correct answer.

This repository is developed for the final project of lecture "深層学習/ DL基礎 2024" at the University of Tokyo.
